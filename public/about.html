<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Govind, and I have recently completed my 10+2 with PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) from St. Xavier's High School (CBSE Board). I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from GL Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management, where I am building a strong foundation in computer science, programming, and digital tools.</p>

<p>In addition to my academics, I have developed practical skills in HTML, which gives me insight into the fundamentals of web development. I am also passionate about video editing, content creation, and social media handling—skills that allow me to combine technology with creativity. I have managed digital content for small projects and understand how to effectively engage with online audiences.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and digital media, I am a dedicated sportsman. I have represented my school at the state level in badminton and basketball, which has taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilience. These experiences on the court have helped me cultivate strong leadership qualities, time management, and the ability to perform under pressure—skills that are equally valuable in both academic and professional settings.</p>
<p>I am a motivated individual, always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges. I’m looking for opportunities—such as internships or project-based work—where I can apply my knowledge and skills while continuing to develop as a versatile and well-rounded professional.</p>
